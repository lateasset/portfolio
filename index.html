        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a Computer Engineer with an early career in DevOps, I acquired a solid experience in gameplay and graphics programming, but also working knowledge of 3D art.
        </p>

        <p>
          Unity 3D and OpenGL/GLSL were my introduction to real-time graphics, but I am currently exploring Unreal Engine while I study design principles.
        </p>

        <p>
          Among my past experiences, the ones involving teamwork were the most fulfilling and especially when participating in creative projects or even when subject to crazy schedules like game jams.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am also in love with (mostly) old movies, history and a good deal of sports.
        </p>

        <h2> Game Jams</h2>

        <h3> Global Game Jam 2025: Spacebubbles </h3>
        <p>
          A dangerous venture in deep space to retrieve slimy bubbles while staying clear from danger.
        </p>
        <p>
          My contribution can be seen especially in level design and decorative 3D art
        </p>
        
        <h3> Ludum Dare April 2025: Coming soon </h3>
        <p>

        <h2> Student projects</h2>
        <h3> Thesis </h3>
        <p>
          As the name implies, the project revolved around the development of an AR solution for position tracking of objects as captured by a Hololens 1 device; it was developed as a client inside Unity engine with accessory networking elements and UWP implementation, and server leveraging the OpenCV library in C++.
        </p>

        <h3> The awakening </h3>
        <p>
          A narrative adventure centered around a mysterious train accident that killed every passenger on boardâ€¦ or did it?
        </p>
        <p>
          I contributed towards 3D art, materials, narrative design and animated elements in game
        </p>

        <h3> The last chance II </h3>
        <p>
          This one was set up as a continuation of the previous, so I was able to recycle assets, the rigging was especially useful even though the resulting video displays terrible animation timing and editing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main focus was on destruction, emission particles and volumetrics, secondarily cloth, dynamic normal painting and human motion
        </p>

        <h3> The last chance I </h3>
        <p>
          This project was geared towards rendering and 3D simulation basics, as well as Graphics pipeline programming.
        </p>
        <p>
          I focused especially on modelling the tanks, rigging them to simulate track dynamics, materials, basic physics simulations and some rendering specificities such as lighting the scene; a mini game was also included, but it got lost to time and especially legacy/deprecated (at least on Mac OS) C++ frameworks OpenGL/GLUT
